**Hans F. Gude** discovered his interest in and facility for drawing as a
pre-teen when he encountered books about the old masters on the shelves of his
home growing up. He spent many hours meticulously reproducing in pencil,
charcoal, or ink the figures he saw in paintings and statues by Michelangelo,
Bernini, Leonardo, and others.

His father, a civil engineer, introduced him to the principles of
draftsmanship and linear perspective---[knowledge he applies in his
landscapes]({{ '/uc-berkeley/campus-drawings' | relative_url }}).

Through high school and for two years of college, Hans studied and practiced
art. He supplemented his coursework with copious reading about art history,
methods, and technique, including design, color theory, materials,
perspective, anatomy, drawing, and painting.

Hans subscribes to a traditional view of art-making, seeing it as a craft, the
goal of which is to produce artworks pleasing to the eye using the
time-honored techniques of design, form, draftsmanship, color harmony, and the
illusion of light.

He adopts Leonardo's advice, moreover, that a painter should not just learn to
do one thing well, but work to achieve proficiency in all manner of methods
and subjects, including landscapes, figures, and portraits.

His preferred mediums include [pencil]({{ '/drawings/pencil' | relative_url
}}), [oil paint]({{ '/by-medium/oils' | relative_url }}), [gouache]({{
'/by-medium/gouache' | relative_url }}), [watercolor]({{
'/by-medium/watercolors' | relative_url }}), [charcoal]({{ '/drawings/charcoal'
| relative_url }}), and [pen & ink]({{ '/drawings/pen-ink' | relative_url }}).
He recently began creating digital art by adding Procreate on an iPad Pro to
his toolbox.

Hans comes by his art interest and talent 'naturally,' being the great-great
grandson of the 19th c. Norwegian romanticist painter <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Gude" target="_blank">Hans F.
Gude</a> (1825--1903), whom he is named after and who at age 29 was appointed
the professor of landscape painting at the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf,
Germany, the preeminent landscape academy in Europe at the time.

Hans is a Southern California native. After completing high school he moved to
Northern California for college, graduating from the [University of
California, Berkeley]({{ '/uc-berkeley' | relative_url }}), with a bachelor's
degree in philosophy. Later he took an MBA degree (finance) from Cal State
East Bay.
